# Game Design Document: Bouncing Ball

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a "Bouncing Ball" game. The game will be implemented in Python, adhering to a modular design with clear object-oriented principles. The primary goal is to create a simple, yet engaging game that is easy to understand and fun to play. This document provides sufficient detail for developers to implement the game mechanics seamlessly.

## 2. Game Overview

The Bouncing Ball game is a single-player arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball, preventing it from falling off the screen. The player earns points by successfully bouncing the ball. The game ends when the ball falls off the screen.

## 3. Core Game Mechanics

*   **Ball Physics:** The ball moves with a constant speed but changes direction upon collision with the paddle or the screen boundaries. Gravity may be added for complexity.
*   **Paddle Control:** The player controls a paddle (a rectangular object) that moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen.
*   **Collision Detection:** The game must detect collisions between the ball and the paddle, and the ball and the screen boundaries.
*   **Bouncing:** When the ball collides with the paddle, its vertical direction is reversed, and its horizontal direction can be influenced based on the location of the collision point on the paddle.

## 4. Gameplay Objectives

*   The primary objective is to keep the ball bouncing for as long as possible.
*   The player aims to achieve a high score by successfully bouncing the ball repeatedly.

## 5. Win/Loss Conditions

*   **Win Condition:** There is no specific win condition. The game continues indefinitely until the player loses.
*   **Loss Condition:** The game ends when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen.

## 6. Level Progression

*   The game starts with a basic configuration (ball speed, paddle size).
*   Difficulty can be increased gradually over time by:
    *   Increasing the ball speed.
    *   Decreasing the paddle size.
    *   Introducing multiple balls.
    *   Adding obstacles.
*   Levels could also be pre-defined with specific layouts of obstacles/targets.

## 7. User Interactions

*   **Paddle Control:**
    *   **Keyboard:** Left and Right arrow keys to move the paddle.
    *   **Mouse:** Mouse movement along the x-axis to control the paddle.
*   **Start Game:** A key (e.g., Spacebar) or button click to start the game.
*   **Pause Game:** A key (e.g., 'P') to pause/unpause the game.

## 8. User Experience (UX) Guidelines

*   **Visual Clarity:** Use clear and contrasting colors for the ball, paddle, and background.
*   **Smooth Movement:** Ensure smooth and responsive movement of the paddle and ball.
*   **Auditory Feedback:** Use sound effects for bouncing and game over events.
*   **Intuitive Controls:** The controls should be easy to learn and use.
*   **Clear Score Display:** The score should be prominently displayed on the screen.
*   **Responsive UI:** The game should respond quickly to user input.

## 9. Scoring System

*   Each successful bounce of the ball off the paddle awards a certain number of points (e.g., 10 points).
*   Bonus points can be awarded for consecutive bounces without missing (combo system).
*   The score is displayed in real-time during the game.
*   At the end of the game, the final score is displayed along with a "Game Over" message.

## 10. Game Layout

*   **Screen Dimensions:** Define the width and height of the game screen (e.g., 800x600 pixels).
*   **Paddle Position:** The paddle is located at the bottom of the screen, centered horizontally.
*   **Ball Initial Position:** The ball starts from a position above the paddle.
*   **Boundaries:** The game screen has boundaries on all four sides.  The top and sides cause the ball to bounce. The bottom results in game over.
*   **(Optional) Obstacles:** Rectangular or circular obstacles can be added to the screen, which will cause the ball to bounce upon collision.

## 11. Special Gameplay Instructions

*   The game starts when the player presses the "Start" key.
*   The player controls the paddle to bounce the ball.
*   The game ends when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen.
*   The player can pause/unpause the game by pressing the "Pause" key.

2.  **Game Loop:** The `run` method contains the main game loop, which handles:
    *   User input (paddle movement, pause).
    *   Updating game state (ball movement, collision detection, score).
    *   Rendering game elements on the screen.
3.  **Collision Detection:** The `check_collision` method detects collisions between the ball and the paddle, screen boundaries, and obstacles.
4.  **Paddle Movement:** The `Paddle` class provides methods to move the paddle left and right.
5.  **Ball Movement:** The `Ball` class provides methods to move the ball and handle bouncing.
6.  **Scoring:** The `Game` class keeps track of the player's score and updates it based on successful bounces.
7.  **Game Over:** The game ends when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen. A "Game Over" screen is displayed with the final score.

## 13. Design Notes for Developers

*   Use a game library like Pygame or Arcade to handle graphics, input, and sound.
*   Implement collision detection efficiently using appropriate algorithms (e.g., AABB collision detection).
*   Structure the code in a modular way, separating concerns into different classes and functions.
*   Pay attention to performance optimization, especially if adding more complex features like multiple balls or obstacles.
*   Consider adding a configuration file to easily adjust game parameters (e.g., ball speed, paddle size).
*   Add comments to the code to explain the logic and functionality.
*   Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage the codebase.

## 14. Future Enhancements

*   **Power-ups:** Add power-ups that can be collected to enhance gameplay (e.g., increased paddle size, ball speed boost).
*   **Multiple Balls:** Introduce multiple balls to increase the challenge.
*   **Different Ball Types:** Add different types of balls with varying properties (e.g., bouncy ball, heavy ball).
*   **Level Editor:** Allow users to create their own levels.
*   **Online Leaderboard:** Implement an online leaderboard to track high scores.
*   **Improved AI:** Add AI-controlled opponents.
