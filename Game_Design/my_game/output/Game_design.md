# Game Design Document: Simple Snake Game

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a simple Snake game. The game will be developed in Python and will adhere to the principles of simplicity and ease of use. This document serves as a guide for developers to implement the game mechanics seamlessly.

## 2. Game Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid. The objective is to eat food items to increase the snake's length without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

**Python Module Name:** `Game`
**Primary Class Name:** `Game`

## 3. Core Game Mechanics

### 3.1. Movement
*   The snake moves continuously in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.
*   The player can change the direction of the snake using keyboard input.
*   The snake's body follows the head, with each segment moving to the position previously occupied by the segment in front of it.

### 3.2. Food Consumption
*   Food items appear randomly on the game grid.
*   When the snake's head collides with a food item, the snake eats the food, and its length increases by one segment.
*   A new food item is generated at a random location after the previous one is eaten.

### 3.3. Collision Detection
*   The game checks for collisions between the snake's head and the walls of the game grid.
*   The game also checks for collisions between the snake's head and its own body.
*   A collision results in the end of the game.

## 4. Gameplay Objectives

*   The primary objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## 5. Win/Loss Conditions

*   **Win Condition:** There is no explicit win condition. The game continues indefinitely until the player loses. However, an implicit win condition can be defined as reaching a specified score or snake length. For the sake of simplicity, we will define no win conditions.
*   **Loss Condition:** The game ends when the snake collides with either:
    *   The walls of the game grid.
    *   Its own body.

## 6. Level Progression

*   The game starts at a defined speed.
*   The speed of the snake can increase as the score increases, making the game progressively more challenging. (Optional)
*   The game area size can be fixed or dynamic. For simplicity, we'll use a fixed size.

## 7. User Interactions

*   **Movement Controls:**
    *   Up Arrow Key: Move the snake up.
    *   Down Arrow Key: Move the snake down.
    *   Left Arrow Key: Move the snake left.
    *   Right Arrow Key: Move the snake right.
*   **Start/Pause:**
    *   Spacebar: Start the game or pause/resume the game. (Optional)
*   **Restart:**
     *  'R' Key: Restart the game after it is over. (Optional)

## 8. User Experience (UX) Guidelines

*   **Visual Clarity:** The game grid, snake, and food items should be easily distinguishable. Use contrasting colors to ensure good visibility.
*   **Responsive Controls:** The snake should respond immediately to player input, providing a smooth and responsive experience.
*   **Clear Feedback:** The game should provide clear feedback to the player, such as:
    *   Displaying the current score.
    *   Indicating when the snake has eaten food.
    *   Displaying a "Game Over" message when the player loses.
*   **Simple Interface:** The game interface should be clean and uncluttered, focusing on the core gameplay elements.

## 9. Scoring System

*   The player's score increases by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 points) each time the snake eats a food item.
*   The score can be displayed prominently on the screen during gameplay.
*   A high score can be stored and displayed after the game ends.

## 10. Game Layout

*   **Grid Size:** The game grid will be of a fixed size (e.g., 20x20 cells).
*   **Walls:** The boundaries of the grid will act as walls.
*   **Initial Snake Position:** The snake will start at the center of the grid with an initial length of 3 segments.
*   **Food Placement:** Food items will be placed randomly on the grid, ensuring that they do not overlap with the snake's body.

## 11. Game Over Logic

1.  When a collision occurs (snake hits wall or itself):
    *   The game pauses.
    *   A "Game Over" message is displayed on the screen, along with the player's final score.
    *   The option to restart the game is presented to the player (e.g., "Press R to Restart").

## 12. Special Gameplay Instructions

*   The snake cannot move directly in the opposite direction of its current movement (e.g., if moving right, the player cannot immediately move left). This prevents the snake from colliding with itself instantly.
*   The game should include a brief set of instructions displayed at the start of the game or in a separate help menu.

## 13. Module: Game

This section details the proposed structure and functionalities within the `Game` module.

### 13.1. Class: `Game`

The primary class that encapsulates the game logic.

#### 13.1.1. Attributes:

*   `grid_width` (int): The width of the game grid.
*   `grid_height` (int): The height of the game grid.
*   `snake` (list of tuples): A list of (x, y) coordinates representing the snake's body segments.
*   `food` (tuple): The (x, y) coordinate of the food item.
*   `direction` (str): The current direction of the snake ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right').
*   `score` (int): The player's current score.
*   `game_over` (bool): A flag indicating whether the game is over.
*   `speed` (int): The game speed, dictating how often the game updates.

#### 13.1.2. Methods:

*   `__init__(self, width, height)`: Initializes the game with the specified grid dimensions. Sets up the initial snake position, food position, score, direction, and game state.
*   `reset(self)`: Resets the game state to its initial configuration. Snake is centered, score is zeroed, and a new food item is generated.
*   `update(self)`: Updates the game state based on the current direction. Moves the snake, checks for collisions, and handles food consumption.
*   `move_snake(self)`: Moves the snake one step in the current direction.
*   `check_collisions(self)`: Checks for collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. Sets `game_over` to `True` if a collision occurs.
*   `eat_food(self)`: Handles the logic for when the snake eats food. Increases the snake's length, updates the score, and generates new food.
*   `generate_food(self)`: Generates a new food item at a random location on the grid, ensuring it does not overlap with the snake.
*   `change_direction(self, new_direction)`: Changes the snake's direction, validating that the new direction is not directly opposite the current direction.
*   `get_state(self)`: Returns the current state of the game, including the snake's position, food position, score, and game over status. This is important for rendering the game and determining if the game has ended.

### 13.2. Functionalities:

*   **Game Initialization:**  The `Game` class constructor should properly initialize the game state.
*   **Game Loop:** The `update` method forms the core of the game loop, handling snake movement, collision detection, and food consumption.
*   **Input Handling:** The `change_direction` method is responsible for processing user input and updating the snake's direction accordingly.
*   **Rendering:** The `get_state` method allows an external system or rendering engine to retrieve the current state of the game for visual representation.
*   **Game Over:** The `check_collisions` method determines if the game is over. Once it is set, the game loop should be halted.
*   **Score Tracking:** Score is updated within the `eat_food` method.

## 14. Design Notes for Developers

*   **Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures for representing the game grid, snake, and food items. Lists and tuples are suitable for the snake and food, while a 2D array could represent the grid, though it is not strictly necessary.
*   **Modular Design:** Break down the game logic into smaller, reusable functions and methods.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to prevent the game from crashing due to unexpected input or conditions.
*   **Optimization:** Consider optimizing the game for performance, especially collision detection and rendering, to ensure smooth gameplay.  This is less critical for a simple implementation but something to keep in mind if more complex features are added.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the game to identify and fix bugs before release.  Pay close attention to edge cases (e.g., snake eating food right before hitting a wall).
