# Game Design Document: Simple Snake Game

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the design for a simple snake game, focusing on clarity and developer-friendliness to enable seamless implementation. The game will be implemented in Python, using the module name `Game` and the primary class name `Game`.

**2. Game Overview**

The snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

**3. Core Game Mechanics**

*   **Movement:** The snake moves continuously in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). The player can change the snake's direction using the arrow keys or WASD keys.
*   **Eating:** When the snake's head collides with food, the snake grows longer, and the food is moved to a new random location on the game board.
*   **Collision:** The game ends if the snake's head collides with the wall or any part of its own body.

**4. Gameplay Objectives**

*   The primary objective is to achieve the highest possible score by eating food and growing the snake.
*   A secondary objective could be to unlock achievements or reach certain score milestones.

**5. Win/Loss Conditions**

*   **Win Condition:** There is no explicit win condition in the traditional sense. The game continues indefinitely until the player loses. A possible win condition could be added if a level progression system is implemented, where each level has a target score.
*   **Loss Condition:** The game ends when the snake's head collides with:
    *   The game board boundaries (walls).
    *   Any part of its own body.

**6. Level Progression**

*   **Initial Implementation:** The initial version of the game will have a single level with a fixed grid size.
*   **Future Enhancements:** Level progression could be implemented by:
    *   Increasing the game speed as the player scores more points.
    *   Introducing obstacles or power-ups.
    *   Changing the size or shape of the game board.
    *   Adding different types of food with varying point values.

**7. User Interactions**

*   **Controls:**
    *   **Movement:**
        *   Up: Up arrow key or 'W' key
        *   Down: Down arrow key or 'S' key
        *   Left: Left arrow key or 'A' key
        *   Right: Right arrow key or 'D' key
    *   **Start/Pause:**
        *   Spacebar: Toggles between pause and resume (optional).
    *   **Restart:**
         *   'R' key : Restarts game when game is over.
*   **User Experience (UX) Guidelines:**
    *   **Responsive Controls:** Ensure that the snake responds immediately to player input.
    *   **Clear Visuals:** Use clear and distinct colors for the snake, food, and background.
    *   **Informative Feedback:** Display the current score prominently on the screen. Display a game over message when the player loses, including the final score.
    *   **Intuitive Interface:** The game should be easy to understand and play without requiring instructions.

**8. Scoring System**

*   **Base Score:** Each piece of food eaten increases the score by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 points).
*   **Score Multiplier (Optional):** A score multiplier could be introduced based on the snake's length or speed, encouraging risky gameplay.
*   **High Score Tracking:** The game should keep track of the highest score achieved and display it to the player.

**9. Game Layout**

*   **Grid-Based:** The game board will be divided into a grid of cells. The snake and food will occupy one or more cells.
*   **Size:** The grid size can be configurable, allowing for different difficulty levels (e.g., 20x20, 30x30).
*   **Boundaries:** The game board will have clearly defined boundaries that the snake cannot pass through.
*   **Visual Representation:** Use a simple visual representation for the snake (e.g., colored blocks or segments), food (e.g., a different colored block), and background (e.g., a solid color).

**10. Special Gameplay Instructions**

*   **Initial Snake Length:** The snake should start with a length of 3-5 segments.
*   **Initial Snake Position:** The snake should start in the center of the game board, moving in a random direction.
*   **Food Generation:** Food should be generated randomly on the game board, ensuring that it does not spawn on top of the snake.
*   **Game Speed:** The game speed (i.e., the rate at which the snake moves) should be adjustable to control the difficulty.
*   **Pause Functionality:** (Optional) Implement a pause function that allows the player to temporarily stop the game without losing progress.

**11. Python Module: `Game`**

*   **Module Name:** `Game`

**12. Primary Class: `Game`**

*   **Class Name:** `Game`
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `grid_width` (int): The width of the game grid.
    *   `grid_height` (int): The height of the game grid.
    *   `snake` (list of tuples): A list of (x, y) coordinates representing the snake's body segments. The head of the snake is the first element in the list.
    *   `food` (tuple): The (x, y) coordinates of the food.
    *   `direction` (str): The current direction of the snake ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right').
    *   `score` (int): The player's current score.
    *   `game_over` (bool): A flag indicating whether the game is over.
    *  `speed` (int): Game speed (frames per move).
*   **Methods:**
    *   `__init__(self, grid_width, grid_height, initial_speed)`: Initializes the game.  Sets up the grid dimensions, places the initial snake, generates the first food item, sets the initial direction, initializes the score, and sets the game_over flag to False. `initial_speed` sets the game speed.
    *   `reset(self)`: Reset the game to begin from fresh.
    *   `spawn_food(self)`: Generates a new food item at a random location on the grid that is not occupied by the snake.
    *   `move(self)`: Moves the snake one step in the current direction.  Checks for collisions with the walls and the snake's body. If a collision occurs, sets the game_over flag to True. If the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases.
    *   `change_direction(self, new_direction)`: Changes the snake's direction, preventing immediate 180-degree turns.
    *   `get_state(self)`: Returns the current state of the game, including the grid size, snake position, food position, score, and game_over status. This can be used for rendering the game or for AI purposes.
    *   `is_valid_move(self, x, y)`: Checks if a given cell (x, y) is within the grid boundaries.
    *   `is_collision(self, x, y)`: Checks if snake collides with its body.
    *   `update(self)`: Handle the game state update. Move snake, check for food eaten and collision, and updates score.
    *   `get_score(self)`: Return the score.

**13. Detailed Gameplay Elements and Design Notes**

*   **Game Initialization:**
    *   The `Game` class should be initialized with the grid dimensions (width and height) and initial speed.
    *   The snake should start in the center of the grid with a length of 3-5 segments.
    *   The initial direction of the snake should be randomly chosen.
    *   The first food item should be generated at a random location on the grid.
*   **Snake Movement:**
    *   The snake moves continuously in the current direction.
    *   The `move()` method should update the snake's position by adding a new segment to the head and removing the last segment of the tail, unless the snake has eaten food.
    *   The `change_direction()` method should update the snake's direction based on player input, preventing immediate 180-degree turns.
*   **Food Consumption:**
    *   When the snake's head collides with the food, the snake grows longer, and the food is moved to a new random location on the grid.
    *   The `spawn_food()` method should generate a new food item at a random location on the grid that is not occupied by the snake.
    *   The score should be updated when the snake eats food.
*   **Collision Detection:**
    *   The game should check for collisions with the walls and the snake's body.
    *   If a collision occurs, the game_over flag should be set to True.
*   **Game Over:**
    *   When the game_over flag is set to True, the game should display a game over message and the final score.
    *   The player should be able to restart the game by pressing a key (e.g., 'R').
*   **Rendering:**
    *   The game state should be rendered on the screen using a suitable graphics library (e.g., Pygame, Tkinter).
    *   The snake, food, and background should be rendered with clear and distinct colors.
    *   The score should be displayed prominently on the screen.
*   **Game Loop:**
    *   The game should run in a loop that updates the game state and renders the game on the screen.
    *   The loop should run at a fixed frame rate to ensure smooth gameplay.
*   **Modular Design:** The code should be modular to facilitate future enhancements and modifications.

**14. Example Class Usage**
```python
# Example usage
from Game import Game

#Game Setup
grid_width = 20
grid_height = 20
initial_speed = 10 #frames per move

game = Game(grid_width, grid_height, initial_speed)

#Game loop Example (this would typically be in your main application)
while not game.game_over:
    #Get player input. example:
    #new_direction = get_player_direction() #Function to handle player input

    #Example direction change
    #game.change_direction(new_direction) #Change direction

    #Update the game state
    game.update()

    #Render the game (implementation not detailed here)
    #render(game.get_state())

    #Delay (Control Game speed)
    #time.sleep(1 / game.speed)
    #Optional delay - based on speed attribute from Game class.

#Game over sequence
final_score = game.get_score()
print(f"Game Over! Final Score: {final_score}")

#Reset the game for another play
#game.reset()
```

**15. Future Enhancements**

*   **Level Progression:** Implement multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
*   **Power-Ups:** Introduce power-ups that grant temporary advantages, such as increased speed or invincibility.
*   **Obstacles:** Add obstacles to the game board that the snake must avoid.
*   **Multiplayer:** Allow multiple players to compete against each other.
*   **AI Opponent:** Implement an AI opponent that plays the game automatically.
*   **Sound Effects and Music:** Add sound effects and music to enhance the game's atmosphere.
